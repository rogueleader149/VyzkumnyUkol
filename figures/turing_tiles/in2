multicomment Coming from right, being in state $s_i$, reading left stop $E_L$ which stands for blank symbol in terms
multicomment of tape alphabet.
multicomment Transition function says: write $a_{l_{i,B}}$, switch to state $s_{k_{i,B}}$ and go left. Note that a glue of strength $2$
comment must have been used.
