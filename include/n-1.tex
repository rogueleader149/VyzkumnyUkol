% another topics: self-assembly of $n\times n$ squares

% we introduced four kinds of resources for DNA computations
% we presented a new tileset which directly simulates TM at $\tau = 2$ in 2D
% we proved some relations between resource consumption of TM and the tileset
% we stated conditions for feasibility
% we proved that classical BPP complies these conditions
% we derived a model suitable for solving $\NP$ problems
% the model directly says which tiles are to be prepared
% we proposed algorithms for $k$-clique, Graph $3$-coloring and Graph Isomorphism
% and computed their complexities
% we performed a simulation in xgrow -- an open source aTAM/kTAM simulator
% => we connected theoretical complexity and aTAM at $\tau = 2$ in 2D
% future/further research: $n\times n$ squares vs. Co(2D)W, periodic properties of 2D words vs. Wang tiling
